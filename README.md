# Lévy Flight

A small *just for fun* implementation of a [Lévy Flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight) mainly based upon this [paper](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-366-random-walks-and-diffusion-fall-2006/6b4ca15455704f5da30ce31906163324_lecture12.pdf). Done in Unity.

Also holds **not one** but **two** implementations to generate Gaussian-distributed random numbers. Wow!
